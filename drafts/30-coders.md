### **30 Techniques for Neurodivergent Coders: A Survival Guide**  

Welcome, fellow chaotic-brained knowledge workers! Whether you have ADHD, autism, both, or just a brain that operates on ‘expert mode’ but forgets why you walked into a room, this guide is for you.  

Coding is hard enough without your brain yeeting random thoughts at you like a cat knocking things off a table. But fear not! We’ve collected a set of **battle-tested** techniques that neurodivergent people use to stay productive, debug code, and (hopefully) not stare at an empty VS Code window for three hours wondering where time went.

## **The Debugging & Problem-Solving Toolbox**
> Because sometimes the bug is you.  

### **1. Rubber Duck Debugging**  
Talk to an inanimate object about your bug. Yes, really. It works.  
- Advanced mode: Talk to your pet. If they give you side-eye, you’re on the right track.  
- Extreme mode: Talk to an actual rubber duck. If it quacks back, you need sleep.  

### **2. Pair Programming, But Make It Imaginary**  
If explaining to a duck isn’t your style, imagine you’re explaining it to a famous developer.  
- “What would Linus Torvalds do?” (Probably yell at you.)  
- “What would Sandi Metz say?” (Write more tests.)  
- “What would ChatGPT do?” (Give a wrong answer with confidence.)  

### **3. Annotated Debugging (a.k.a. "Dear Diary, My Code is a Mess")**  
Write down every single step you take while debugging. It helps when you inevitably forget why you added that `print("WHY DOES THIS WORK??")` statement.  

### **4. Walkaway Debugging**  
If your brain refuses to cooperate, **go do something else**.  
- The shower is a classic, but if you don’t want to overthink in the wet void, try going for a walk, making tea, or chasing your dog around the house.  
- 90% of breakthroughs happen when you step away from the keyboard.  

### **5. Sleep on It Debugging**  
Write down the problem before bed. Your brain might work on it while you sleep.  
- Bonus: Wake up at 3 AM with an idea, forget it by morning.  
- Extra bonus: Dream that your function is sentient and wants revenge.

## **Focus & Attention Tricks**
> Keeping your brain on task: an extreme sport.  

### **6. Body Doubling**  
Work alongside someone—virtually or IRL. This works even if they’re not coding.  
- If you don’t have a human handy, YouTube lo-fi coworking streams or AI-generated fake office sounds work.  

### **7. Hyperfocus Onboarding**  
Use your hyperfocus powers **strategically**. If you’re locked in, direct that laser brain at foundational knowledge rather than fighting a bug for hours with brute force.  

### **8. Intentional Context Switching**  
If your attention span is a Windows XP Task Manager, switch things up before you completely crash.  
- Rotate tasks: 45 min coding → 10 min admin → 45 min debugging.  

### **9. The "One Tab" Rule (If You Can Handle It)**  
Limit yourself to **one work-related tab**. (Yes, YouTube speedruns count as *not work*.)  
- Advanced mode: Use a browser extension to temporarily lock non-essential sites.  
- Impossible mode: No tabs at all.  

### **10. Reverse Pomodoro**  
Instead of forcing yourself into 25-minute work sprints, **work until you naturally lose focus**, then take a break. Neurodivergent brains often struggle with stopping hyperfocus, so work **with** your flow instead of against it.

## **Task & Memory Management (a.k.a. External Brain Techniques)**
> Because RAM is limited, even in your head.  

### **11. Externalized Working Memory**  
Offload **everything** onto digital or physical tools.  
- Use a whiteboard, Joplin, Notion, or a good ol’ sticky note collection.  

### **12. Checklist Coding**  
Create a **pre-flight checklist** for common tasks:  
- [ ] Check logs  
- [ ] Verify function inputs  
- [ ] Clear caches  
- [ ] Realize you were debugging the wrong file  

### **13. Incremental Problem Solving ("Lego Bricking")**  
Don’t try to build **the whole thing** at once. Solve it in **tiny, testable pieces**.  

### **14. "Future Me" Notes**  
Leave a comment explaining what you were doing, because "Future You" won’t remember.  
- Bad: `//fix later`  
- Good: `// Function must handle null inputs because API sometimes returns garbage`

## **Energy & Motivation Hacks**
> Because burnout is real.  

### **15. Context-Based Task Selection**  
Pick tasks based on your **energy level**.  
- *High energy*: Algorithm design.  
- *Low energy*: Refactoring and documentation.  

### **16. Micro-Rewards ("Bribing Yourself")**  
- "Finish this function → Get a snack."  
- "Write tests → Watch a cat video."  
- "Deploy code → Touch grass."  

### **17. Rituals & Anchors**  
Start your coding session with a ritual:  
- A specific playlist  
- Making a drink  
- Telling your houseplant that today's the day you finally refactor that spaghetti code  

### **18. Alternate Input Methods**  
Tired of typing? Try dictating notes or pseudocode.  
- Works great for writing user stories or documentation.  
- Not great for writing actual code unless you enjoy saying, "New line… indent… tab… backspace… I HATE THIS!"

## **Collaboration & Communication**
> Because working with humans is also part of coding.  

### **19. Asynchronous Pairing (a.k.a. "Leave a Voice Note, Walk Away")**  
Instead of real-time pair programming, leave **recorded explanations**.  
- Pro: Less pressure.  
- Con: You have to listen to your own voice later.  

### **20. Ask AI First (But Verify)**  
Before asking a human, phrase your question for an AI first. It helps refine your thoughts and sometimes gives **half-useful** answers.  

### **21. The "Rubber Duck Peer Review"**  
Before submitting code, **pretend you're reviewing someone else's work**.  
- Would Future You understand this?  
- Would you be ashamed if this hit production?  

### **22. Thought Map Coding**  
Before writing a single line of code, **sketch out your idea** as a mind map.  

### **23. Selective Overcommunication**  
If meetings stress you out, **overcommunicate asynchronously** with detailed notes instead.

## **Final Thoughts: No One-Size-Fits-All**  
Not all of these techniques will work for everyone. Try them, mix them up, and **embrace what makes your brain unique**.  

The best productivity method is the one that **actually works for you**—even if it involves talking to a rubber duck at 3 AM.
