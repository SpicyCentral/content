# Social Interactions

Here’s a structured list of techniques neurodivergent people can apply to manage social interactions and responsibilities while reducing anxiety. I've grouped them into categories based on common challenges.

## **Work & Task Management**
These techniques help clarify expectations and avoid misunderstandings.

- **Clarification Checklist (Ask Before You Start)**  
  - ✅ **What exactly is needed?** (Scope, deliverables)  
  - ✅ **When is this needed?** (Deadline, urgency)  
  - ✅ **Why is this important?** (Context, dependencies)  
  - ✅ **Who is responsible for what?** (Your role vs. others')  
  - ✅ **How should I deliver it?** (Preferred format, tools)  
  - ✅ **What happens if I get stuck?** (Who to ask for help)  

- **Confirm Understanding**  
  - Repeat the request back in your own words to verify expectations.  
  - Ask for examples if something seems vague.  
  - Request documentation or templates if possible.  

- **Break Tasks into Smaller Steps**  
  - Write down each step to make the task feel less overwhelming.  
  - Use a visual tool (checklist, kanban board) to track progress.  

- **Preemptively Set Boundaries**  
  - If your schedule is full, say: _"I can take this on, but I’ll need to adjust priorities. Which task should come first?"_  
  - If you need more information, say: _"Before I start, can we clarify XYZ to make sure I get this right?"_

## **Social Situations & Communication**
These strategies help make interactions smoother and reduce social anxiety.

- **Default Phrases for Difficult Situations**  
  - If you need time to think: _"Let me get back to you on that."_  
  - If you don’t know something: _"I’m not sure, but I can find out."_  
  - If you’re uncomfortable answering: _"I’d rather not say."_  
  - If you need a conversation to end: _"I have to go, but let’s pick this up later."_
 
- **Script Your Responses for Common Scenarios**  
  - Prepare for small talk: _"How’s your week been?" → "Busy, but good. You?"_  
  - Respond to criticism constructively: _"I see what you mean. How would you suggest improving it?"_  
  - Handle interruptions: _"Can I finish my thought first?"_
  
  Probably not: "I've not seen you for a while" "Yeah, I've been avoiding you..."


- **Use “Pre-Exit” Plans for Overwhelming Events**  
  - Arrange a time limit in advance (_“I can stay for an hour”_).  
  - Have an excuse ready (_“I have an early morning, so I’ll head out soon”_).  
  - Find a quiet place if overstimulated (_“I just need a minute to reset”_).

## **Emotional Regulation & Overwhelm Management**
These techniques help handle emotional overload in social or work settings.

- **Pause Before Reacting**  
  - If something upsets you, take a breath before responding.  
  - Use a neutral phrase to buy time (_“I’ll need a moment to think about that”_).  

- **Self-Regulation Techniques**  
  - Carry a sensory tool (fidget toy, smooth stone, fabric swatch).  
  - Use a grounding exercise (name 5 things you see, 4 things you feel, 3 things you hear…).  
  - Use a movement break (walk, stretch, squeeze a stress ball).  

- **Plan Recovery Time**  
  - After social events, schedule quiet time to decompress.  
  - Use an “energy budget” (plan activities based on how much energy they’ll take).

## **Managing Unstructured or Unclear Situations**
These techniques help navigate ambiguity and unexpected changes.

- **Clarify Ambiguous Expectations**  
  - If a request is vague, ask: _"What would success look like?"_  
  - If a change happens suddenly, ask: _"How does this affect my priorities?"_  

- **Have a Backup Plan for Uncertainty**  
  - If an event is unpredictable, set an exit strategy (_"If X happens, I’ll do Y"_).  
  - If you feel lost in a meeting, take notes and ask questions later.  

- **Reframe Mistakes as Learning Opportunities**  
  - Instead of self-criticism, ask: _"What can I do differently next time?"_  
  - Remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes.

## **Building Better Boundaries & Assertiveness**
These techniques help you protect your energy while staying professional.

- **Set Clear Limits**  
  - If someone asks for too much: _"I can do X, but Y is outside my capacity."_  
  - If someone interrupts repeatedly: _"Let me finish this thought first."_  

- **Practice Saying “No” Without Guilt**  
  - Offer an alternative (_"I can’t do that, but I could help with XYZ."_).  
  - Keep it short (_"I don’t have time right now."_).  

- **Use Email/Chat Instead of Verbal Communication When Possible**  
  - Gives you time to process responses.  
  - Reduces anxiety in real-time conversations.

## **Executive Function & Decision Fatigue**
These techniques help with decision-making and reducing mental load.

- **Use Decision Frameworks**  
  - **Eisenhower Matrix:** Urgent vs. important tasks.  
  - **If-Then Rules:** Predefine choices to avoid overthinking (_“If I have less than 30 minutes, I’ll do a small task”_).  

- **Automate & Reduce Choices**  
  - Simplify meal choices (rotate a few favorite meals).  
  - Use a default outfit for work to reduce morning decisions.  

- **Use External Memory Aids**  
  - Set calendar reminders for deadlines and appointments.  
  - Use sticky notes or apps for tracking to-dos.
